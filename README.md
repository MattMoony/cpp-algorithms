# Algorithms
_I am speed!_

## About

A collection of interesting algorithms. Whilst some are rather simple, I hope to cover many complex ones as well (as long as their performant and applicable to real-world problems).

The purpose of this repository is to boost my, and maybe even your, knowledge and understanding of computer algorithms and C++. In general, learning/discovering something new everyday is a lovely thing.

## References

The following is a list of the sites I use to gather information about the algorithms covered in this repo:

* [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/)
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)
* [Techie Delight](https://www.techiedelight.com/)

_This list will probably continue growing as this repository keeps expanding._
